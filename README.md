Code for the game Super Nova Party by Delayed Games

SuperNova Party is a online multiplayer board-style party game set in space! The code attached in this project is for the turn-based gameplay of the main board.
There is currently one minigame attached, a third-person shooter last man standing game with 2 types of enemy AI. This minigame is made based on the Udemy class: 
Unreal Engine 4 Mastery: Create Multiplayer Games with C++ by Tom Looman and Epic Games. As the base code is not mine I did not want to upload it, but I can discuss the topics learned and used if required.
